# Trade-off Evaluation Through Refined Exact Epsilon-Constraint Solver (TETREES)

TETREES is a Python-based optimization framework that leverages the Gurobi solver and implements the exact ε-constraint method to address the limitations of conventional multi-objective optimization techniques, particularly addressing service-to-resource assignment problems.
