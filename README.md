# Trade-off Evaluation Through Refined Exact Epsilon-Constraint Solver (TETREES)

TETREES is a Python-based optimization framework that leverages the Gurobi solver and implements the exact ε-constraint method to address the limitations of conventional multi-objective optimization techniques, particularly addressing service-to-resource assignment problems.

## Getting TETREES

TETREES is available via Git at this link. To obtain TETREES enter into the your prefered folder and write the following syntax:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fdrcdtrz/TETREES.git
```
To synchronize the project repository with the local copy, you can run the pull sub-command. The syntax is as follows:
```
$ git pull
```
To run the framework you also need:

- MATLAB software, available at this link; https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html
- Gurobi Optimization software and license. First of all, obtain your Gurobi Optimization license: you will see it on the Gurobi Optimization website, section User Portal. In the licenses tab, for a license with a given ID, click the installation icon on the right. A window will pop up with a guide to follow. You'll be asked to install the Gurobi Optimizer software on your computer (https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software/), download the license through the red Download License button, and then install it via the suggested command  (e.g., 'grbgetkey <license-key>'; copy and input it in a command/terminal prompt. This command required an active internet connection to communicate with the Gurobi servers.
Getting a Gurobi license allows you to run bigger instances of the optimization problem.
